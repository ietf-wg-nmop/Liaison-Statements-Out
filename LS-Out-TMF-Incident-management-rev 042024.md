The IETF Network Management OPerations (NMOP) Working Group [1] was recently chartered by the IETF to focus on network management operations. The current topics of focus for the NMOP WG are as follows:

* NETCONF/YANG Push integration with Apache Kafka & time series databases
*	Anomaly detection and incident management
*	Issues related to deployment/usage of YANG topology modules (e.g., to model a Digital Map)
*	Consider/plan an approach for updating RFC 3535-bis (collecting updated operator requirements for IETF network management solutions)

The NMOP WG would like to inform the TMF that the Working Group is currently considering the following documents for adoption:

*	A terminology document for anomaly and incident management [2]
*	A document on network incident management [3]

We are planning a formal call for adoption for these two documents in the coming weeks.

The NMOP WG believes that this work might be relevant to the ongoing "TMF724A Incident Management API Profile" [4] and would like to coordinate ongoing efforts in both the IETF and TMF early in the standardization process.
Such coordination is meant to ensure that produced specifications are complementary and soften overlapping areas (if any).

To that aim, the NMOP WG would appreciate if the TMF can provide a copy of "TMF724A Incident Management API Profile" specification that can be made available to the IETF participants.

We look forward fruitful collaboration between TMF and NMOP WG.

Note that the NMOP WG encourages the use of NMOP WG mailing list [5] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions, and clarifying concerns.
Also, the NMOP WG is welcoming presentations from TMF on the these matters. Request for presentations can be sent to the NMOP Chairs [5].

Following is the schedule of upcoming meetings of the IETF [6]:

* 20 July 2024 - 26 July 2024, Vancouver Canada
* 02 Nov 2024 - 08 Nov 2024, Dublin Ireland

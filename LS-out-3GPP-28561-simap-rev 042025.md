The IETF has a Working Group (WG) on Network Management OPerations (NMOP WG) [1] which focuses
on investigating issues related to the deployment and usage of YANG topology modules in order to model networks and services.

Specifically, the WG is finalizing "SIMAP: Concept, Requirements, and Use Cases" [2] which defines
the concept of Service & Infrastructure Maps (SIMAP). The SIMAP is a data model that provides a
view of the operator's networks and services, including how it is connected to other models/data (e.g., inventory, observability
sources, and operational knowledge). The SIMAP is applicable to multiple domains (access, core, data center, etc.) and
technologies (Optical, IP, etc.). The SIMAP specification explains its connection to the Network Digital Twin (NDT).

The NMOP WG believes that existing data models can be leveraged in the context of NDT beyond the IETF. Concretely, the SIMAP is a key foundation for building the NDT, independent of the applications
that will use this NDT. For example, this effort can be leveraged for the ongoing 3GPP effort on "Management and orchestration; Management aspects of Network Digital Twins" (TS 28.561).

We look forward fruitful collaboration between the 3GPP and NMOP WG on these matters.

The NMOP WG encourages the use of NMOP WG mailing list [3] as the most effective and expedient
way of exchanging information, answering questions, and progressing any work.

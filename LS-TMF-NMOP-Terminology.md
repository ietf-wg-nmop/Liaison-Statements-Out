As a follow-up to the LS [1] sent by the IETF Network Management OPerations Working Group (NMOP WG) [2] to TMF,
we are pleased to inform you that the WG is planning to issue a WG Last Call for the following document: 

*	Some Key Terms for Network Fault and Problem Management [3]

The terms defined in this document are principally intended for
   consistent use within the IETF. Where similar concepts are described
   in other bodies, an attempt has been made to harmonize with those
   other descriptions. However, there is care needed where terms are not used
   consistently between bodies or where terms are applied outside the
   network layer.

The NMOP WG believes that this work might be relevant to the TMF and would welcome comments.

Note that the NMOP WG encourages the use of NMOP WG mailing list [5] as the most effective and expedient way of exchanging information, answering questions, and clarifying concerns.
